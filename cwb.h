/**
 * CWB API (Plain C WebBrowser Control mini API) - Header file
 *
 * Version 1.0, Jan 2022 by Eric M.
 *
 * CWB (C WebBrowser) API is a minimalist implementation of a WebBrowser control
 * adapted to C WinAPI environment. The API allow to embed a WebBrowser
 * control instance (Internet Explorer/Trident) within a common WinAPI window.
 *
 * This mini API is widely inspired from the Codeguru's CWebPage.c example (see
 * link bellow) with help of the René Nyffenegger's C++ implementation (see link
 * bellow) for frame resize handling and navigation interception.
 *
 * Codeguru's Plain C Web Page tutorial :
 *  https://www.codeguru.com/network/display-a-web-page-in-a-plain-c-win32-application/
 *
 * René Nyffenegger's MSHTML Web Browser demonstration :
